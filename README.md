# Consumer-Complaint-Categorization-for-Financial-Services

## Overview
This project focuses on automating the process of classifying and routing customer complaints to the appropriate department. In a large organization, manually sorting through thousands of customer complaints is inefficient and time-consuming. This solution leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to automatically assign a product category to a given complaint text, improving efficiency and response time.
The model is trained on a dataset of customer complaints and can predict the category for new, unseen complaints.
